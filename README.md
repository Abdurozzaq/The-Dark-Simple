# The Dark Simple
This repository is based on the dwinawan design "https://dribbble.com/dwinawan", the pictures I took randomly on the unsplash "https://unsplash.com/s/photos/skateboard".

For now there is only one page, namely the home page. But there will be further updates, so please support me by give stars to this repository.
